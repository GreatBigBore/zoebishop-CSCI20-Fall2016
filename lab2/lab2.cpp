//Guessing Game Algorithm
 
//Computer generates number between 1-10 (save as variable numComputer)
//Input - User enters number (save as variable numUser)  
//If numComputer = numUser, display message "You win!" 
//add 10 to variable numPoints (variable initially starts at value of 0)
//If numComputer doesn't equal numUser, display message "Guess higher" if numComputer is > numUser, or "Guess lower" if numCOmputer is < numUser
//User enters new number, saved as new value for numUser
//User enters new number until numComputer = numUser
//Subtract 1 from numPoints for every time numComputer doesn't equal numUser
